# Scrooge-Coin

> Designing a cryptocurrency similar to ScroogeCoin.


## Description
In this project ,a network of 100 users will simulate the transaction processes. Initially each user will have 10 ScroogCoins. As long as the system is running, a random transaction with random amount (within the range of amount the user has) will be created from User A to User B. The transaction is signed by the private-key of the sender. Scrooge get notified by every transaction. Scrooge verifies the signature before accumulating the transaction. Once Scrooge accumulates 10 transaction, he can form a block and attach it to the blockchain.
